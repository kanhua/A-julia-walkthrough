This is a set of tutorials of Julia language, currently written in traditional Chinese (zh-tw)。They were originally published in an Taiwanese IT forum. 

This is a project-oriented tutorial that introduces the essentials of Julia to the reader through a console version of 2048 game. The implementation of 2048 is not diffucult and the nature of this game forms an excellent way to demonstrate many important features of this lanugage, such as arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, vector/matrix operation, parallel computing, and so on. 

I have plans to write an English version for this set of tutorials after I finish the Chinese version. If you are interested in this project and would like to receive the update of my progress. Please "watch" or "star" this repository.
